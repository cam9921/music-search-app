# music-search-app
Simple Spotify music search app. Made to practice using the Spotify API and be a jumping-off point for more advanced music apps. 

Currently allows user to search for artists through the Spotify API. User can select those artist, view some basic details, and follow link to listen to that artist on spotify. 

Current Goals: 1 - Add automatic authentication, rather than the static key contained in auth/spotifyTokens.js
               2 - Pull data from my Discover Weekly playlist. Eventual functionality will provide details on reccomendations, and update discover weekly history playlist.
               3 - Later, should allow users to connect their accounts and do the same.
